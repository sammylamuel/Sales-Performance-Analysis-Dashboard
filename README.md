  ## Process
## Data Transformation
- Format the 'sales date' field into a proper date format so that Excel can handle it in calculations and analysis.
- Verify that 'sales value' and 'sales quantity' are numeric.
- use Excelâ€™s *VALUE() function to convert any improperly formatted data.
- Identify any missing or invalid data entries and handle them by either filling them in if possible or removing the affected rows
- Ensure that your data is clean and structured
